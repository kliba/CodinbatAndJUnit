CoodingBatWithJunit***

It is motivated by the https://codingbat.com website. In this source you can find the Java solutions. These are my solutions so different thinking can make different solutions for these Java problems. Anyway, it is useful to read through to develop the code understanding skill. Every package has 2 classes.

The App named one is the entry point of the chapter. There all of the methods are revoked so if you need to print that you can write a System.out.print.... method and you are going to see the return value. As I implemented them column by column there are a section comment after every column: e.g: //******https://codingbat.com/java/AP-1******third column It could help navigate you.

The other class contains the implementations. The structure is it starts the task desc itself as a comment. Then the method. It is rarely commented. The part what seemed to be more difficult to me I commented them. Here you can find the section separator comment.

I hope you also find it an useful exercising and if you have a comment you would like to share it to me, pls do not hesitate to do it via github. my acc: https://github.com/kliba

Prerequisites This project does not need any advance installation before you execute it. Only needs jUnit test what is a default one if you open a new gradle project. The 'build.gradle' file has to contain this dependenci: testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.12' For further information please, find the build.gradle file what is located by CoodingBatWithJunit/build.gradle path.

Running the tests

It is using jUnit test technology. Kind of TDD test. Contains nly those test cases what is implemented on the https://codingbat.com website. Easy to follow the test structure. i.e: CoodingBatWithJunit/src/test/java/array1test/Array1Test.java is testing the CoodingBatWithJunit/src/main/java/array1/Array1.java file.

Built With Using gradle project builder version of '1.0-SNAPSHOT'. It uses only the default gradle dependencies. What means jUnit test. For more information please find the following files in the projects: CoodingBatWithJunit/settings.gradle CoodingBatWithJunit/gradlew.bat CoodingBatWithJunit/gradlew CoodingBatWithJunit/build.gradle

License As this is opensource does not need any license. Feel free to read and/or use my solutions and I am happy if it could support you a lieetle bit at least.

Acknowledgments Inspiration to practice the methods implementations. Founded codingbat website what contains may tasks and patterns to implement. Many thanks to Nick Parlante whose this original project. It was a pleasure to resolve his exercises.
