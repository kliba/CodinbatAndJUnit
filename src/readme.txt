*******This is a short description about this project**********

It is motivated by the https://codingbat.com website.
In this source you can find the Java solutions.
These are my solutions so different thinking can make different solutions for these Java problems.
Anyway, it is useful to read through to develop the code understanding skill.
I hope you also find it an useful exercising and if you have a comment you would like to share it to me,
pls do not hesitate to do it via github.

About the project structure:
src/main/java..
the java package contains the same nam as the relevant chapter is on the codingbat.

Every package has 2 classes.

The App named one is the entry point of the chapter. There all of the methods are revoked so if you need
to print that you can write a System.out.print.... method and you are going to see the return value.
As I implemented them column by column there are a section comment after every column:
e.g: //******https://codingbat.com/java/AP-1******third column
It could help navigate you.

The other class contains the implementations. The structure is it starts the task desc itself as a comment.
Then the method. It is rarely commented. The part what seemed to be more difficult to me I commented them.
Here you can find the section separator comment.

jUnit_test
main/test/java..
then the package name starts as the implementation package ans added a "test" word to it.
These contain onl the TDD tests using jUnit tech.
The test data are exactly same as the solutions are tested on the codingbat website.


Others:
Used gradle to create this project.
Used git to version control.
